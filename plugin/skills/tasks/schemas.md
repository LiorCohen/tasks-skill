# Task and Plan Schemas

Reference documentation for task and plan file formats.

## Task Schema

All task files use YAML frontmatter.

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | number | yes | Unique task number |
| `title` | string | yes | Short title |
| `type` | enum | no | `epic` or `change`. Default `change` (omit for change tasks). Epics are containers that group related child tasks under a shared objective. |
| `priority` | enum | no | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `inherit` (unset = unprioritized). `inherit` is only valid on tasks with `parent_epic` — the task inherits its epic's priority. |
| `status` | enum | yes | `inbox`, `speccing`, `planning`, `plan-review`, `implementing`, `reviewing`, `complete`, `rejected`, `consolidated` |
| `parent_epic` | number | no | ID of the parent epic (only on child tasks of an epic) |
| `created` | datetime | yes | `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC` — **must run `date -u` to get actual time, never invent** |
| `completed` | datetime | no | `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC` (when status=complete) — **must run `date -u` to get actual time, never invent** |
| `consolidated_into` | number | no | Task ID (when status=consolidated) |
| `rejected_reason` | string | no | Reason for rejection (when status=rejected) |
| `repos` | string[] | no | Repo directory names affected by this task. Empty `[]` for single-repo projects. |
| `depends_on` | number[] | no | Task IDs this depends on |
| `blocks` | number[] | no | Task IDs blocked by this |

### Task File Template

```markdown
---
id: 63
title: Short descriptive title
priority: medium
status: inbox
created: 2026-01-30 14:00 UTC
repos: []
depends_on: []
blocks: []
---

# Task 63: Short descriptive title

## Description

Full description of what needs to be done.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
```

### Epic Task Template

Epics are container tasks that group related child tasks. They have `type: epic` in frontmatter and list their children in a `## Children` section. Epics do not have their own Changes table — the children carry the actual changes.

```markdown
---
id: 175
title: Overhaul authentication system
type: epic
priority: high
status: speccing
created: 2026-02-27 16:00 UTC
repos: [sdd-core]
---

# Overhaul authentication system

## Description

High-level objective that this group of tasks achieves together.

## Motivation

Why this body of work is needed as a cohesive unit.

## Scope

### In scope

- Area 1 (covered by #176)
- Area 2 (covered by #177)

### Out of scope

- What this epic explicitly does NOT cover

## Children

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| [#176](../1-speccing/176/task.md) | Add JWT token refresh | speccing |
| [#177](../0-inbox/177/task.md) | Migrate session store to Redis | inbox |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All child tasks are complete
- [ ] Integration between children is verified
```

**IMPORTANT:** Epics do NOT have a Changes section. Each child task defines its own changes independently. The epic's acceptance criteria focus on the overall objective and integration between children.

**Child task backlink:** Every child task must have `parent_epic: <id>` in its frontmatter, linking back to the parent epic.

---

### Specced Task Template

After speccing, task.md must have all 6 required sections with meaningful content:

```markdown
---
id: 63
title: Short descriptive title
priority: medium
status: speccing
created: 2026-01-30 14:00 UTC
repos: [sdd-core]
---

# Short descriptive title

## Description

What this task does — clear, specific, not a rough sketch.

## Motivation

Why this change is needed. What problem it solves. What breaks without it.

## Scope

### In scope

- Specific change 1
- Specific change 2

### Out of scope

- What this task explicitly does NOT cover

## Constraints

- Technical constraints, compatibility requirements, limits
- Rules that must be followed during implementation

## Changes

Every change must be fully defined here — exact files, exact changes, no ambiguity. Never defer decisions to planning or label anything a "planning detail." The plan builds an execution order for changes decided here.

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `path/to/file.md` | What changes and why |
| `path/to/other.ts` | What changes and why |

## Acceptance Criteria

Each criterion must have an external verification method — a command, test, or observable output that proves it works without relying on Claude's self-assessment.

- [ ] Criterion — **verify:** `command or test that proves it`
- [ ] Criterion — **verify:** `command or test that proves it`
```

### Completed Task Template

priority: medium
status: consolidated
created: 2026-01-20 10:00 UTC
consolidated_into: 27
---

# Task 28: Schema validation skill → consolidated into #27

<!-- Original content preserved below -->

## Description

[Original description content remains here unchanged]

## Acceptance Criteria

[Original acceptance criteria remain here unchanged]
```

**IMPORTANT:** When consolidating, the original task content MUST be preserved in full. Only the frontmatter and title are modified.

### Rejected Task Template

```markdown
---
id: 15
title: Feature that was rejected
priority: medium
status: rejected
created: 2026-01-20 10:00 UTC
rejected_reason: Out of scope for MVP
---

# Task 15: Feature that was rejected ✗

<!-- Original content preserved below -->

## Description

[Original description content remains here unchanged]

## Acceptance Criteria

[Original acceptance criteria remain here unchanged]
```

**IMPORTANT:** When rejecting, the original task content MUST be preserved in full. Only the frontmatter and title are modified.

---

## Changes Schema

Changes are stored as `changes.md` inside the task folder. They are always generated when moving to review or completing a task. They capture **all changes made during the task's lifetime** across all lifecycle stages (planning, implementing, reviewing). Task management changes (`.tasks/` files) are excluded.

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `generated` | datetime | yes | `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC` |
| `branch` | string | yes | Feature branch name (workspace) |
| `commits` | number | yes | Number of commits on workspace branch |
| `repo_branches` | object | no | Mapping of repo name → branch name (multi-repo tasks) |
| `repo_commits` | object | no | Mapping of repo name → commit count (multi-repo tasks) |

### Changes File Template (always generated)

```markdown
---
generated: 2026-02-12 14:30 UTC
branch: feature/task-19-slug
commits: 5
---

# Task #19 — Changes

**Files changed:** 8 (+142 / -37 lines)

| File | Added | Removed |
|------|------:|--------:|
| [`src/cli.ts`](src/cli.ts) | +45 | -12 |
| [`src/types.ts`](src/types.ts) | +20 | -3 |
```

### Detailed Change Report (appended on user request)

When the user requests a detailed change report, append per-file diff sections below the summary table:

```markdown
---

## 1. [`src/cli.ts`](src/cli.ts)

Refactored command routing to use a dispatch map.

\`\`\`diff
<actual diff for this file>
\`\`\`

---

## 2. [`src/types.ts`](src/types.ts)

Added CommandResult type.

\`\`\`diff
<actual diff for this file>
\`\`\`
```

---

## Plan Schema

Plans are stored as `plan.md` inside the task folder. They are execution plans — implementation order, sequencing, and test plan for changes already fully defined in the spec. They are created during the planning phase and move with the task through its lifecycle.

### Frontmatter Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `title` | string | yes | Plan title |
| `created` | datetime | yes | `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC` |
| `updated` | datetime | no | `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC` (last modification) |
| `repos` | string[] | yes | Repo directory names affected by this task. Empty array `[]` for single-repo projects. |

# Plan: Task Management Skill

## Execution Order

Step-by-step implementation sequence. Each step references changes from the spec and describes HOW to implement them, in what order, and with what dependencies.

### Step 1: [Component/area — what to do first]

- Files: `path/to/file.ts`, `path/to/other.ts`
- Why first: no dependencies, other steps build on this
- Implementation approach: brief strategy notes

### Step 2: [Component/area — what to do next]

- Files: `path/to/file.ts`
- Depends on: Step 1
- Implementation approach: brief strategy notes

### Step 3: [Tests]

- Write tests for steps 1–2
- Depends on: Steps 1–2

## Tests

### Unit Tests
- [ ] `test_description_of_behavior`
- [ ] `test_another_behavior`

### Integration Tests
- [ ] `test_components_work_together`

### E2E Tests (if applicable)
- [ ] `test_user_facing_flow`

## Verification

- [ ] Outcome 1 is achieved
- [ ] Outcome 2 is achieved
```

### Plan Content Guidelines

**Plans are execution plans, not specs.** The spec defines WHAT changes to make. The plan defines HOW to execute them — in what order, with what dependencies, and what implementation strategy.

| Include in Plans | Do NOT Include in Plans |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| Execution order and sequencing | Re-stating what changes to make (that's the spec) |
| Implementation strategy per step | Full code implementations |
| Dependencies between steps | Decisions about what to change |
| Brief code snippets as constraints | Line-by-line instructions |
| Test plan | Algorithm details |

**Never redefine changes.** If a plan needs to describe what's changing, the spec is incomplete — go back and update the spec, not the plan.

**Tests are required:** Every plan must include an extensive list of tests. Tests define expected behavior and can be reviewed before implementation begins.
